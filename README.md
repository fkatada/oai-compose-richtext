> compose-richtext library and all its modules are very experimental. The roadmap is unclear at the moment. Thanks for your patience. Fork option is available as always.

A collection of Compose libraries for working with rich text formatting and documents.

Aside from `printing`, and `slideshow`, all modules are Kotlin Multiplatform Compose Libraries.

This repo is currently very experimental and really just proofs-of-concept: there are no tests and some things
might be broken or very non-performant.

```kotlin
@Composable fun App() {
  val printController = rememberPrintableController()

  Printable(printController) {
    RichText(Modifier.background(color = Color.White)) {
      Heading(0, "Title")
      Text("Summary paragraph.")

      HorizontalRule()

      BlockQuote {
        Text("A wise person once saidâ€¦")
      }
    }
  }

  Button(onClick = { printController.print("README") }) {
    Text("PRINT ME")
  }
}
